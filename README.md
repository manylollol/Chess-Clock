# Chess Clock

A digital chess clock built from scratch using microcontrollers, rotary encoders, LEDs, and a large LCD display. Tracks time and turns for each player. Includes RGB indicators and two buzzers (one for each player) for alerts.

## Components
- Arduino Nano  
- LCD Display (PCF8574-based)  
- Rotary Encoders (2)  
- Push Buttons (4)  
- RGB LEDs (2)  
- Buzzers (2)  
- Wires and resistors as needed  

## Features
- Large LCD display for clear time visibility  
- Dual buzzers for separate player alerts  
- RGB LEDs indicate active player and time warnings  
- Turn counter for each player  
- Compact and ergonomic layout for comfortable use  
- Adjustable time settings via rotary encoders  

## Usage
1. Assemble all components according to the wiring diagram.  
2. Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller.  
3. Use the player buttons to switch turns and track time accurately.  
4. Watch the LCD for time updates and listen for buzzer/LED alerts as time runs low.  

## Notes
- See journal entries for design process, CAD models, and testing stages.  
- Double-check all connections for the LCD and buzzers before powering the circuit.
