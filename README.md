# Chess Clock

A digital chess clock built from scratch using microcontrollers, rotary encoders, LEDs, and an LCD display. Tracks time and turns for each player. Includes RGB indicators and a buzzer for alerts.

## Components
- Arduino Nano
- TM1637 Displays (2)
- Rotary Encoders (2)
- Push Buttons (4)
- RGB LEDs (2)
- Buzzer (1)
- Wires and resistors as needed

## Usage
1. Assemble components according to wiring diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller.
3. Use the buttons to switch turns and monitor time. 
4. Observe LED and buzzer alerts as time runs low.

## Notes
- See journal entries for design, CAD models, and testing steps.
- Ensure correct wiring for displays and buttons before powering on.
