## 10/19/2025 10:00 PM - Did some research about the components I’m using and started  

I was doing some research about how real chess clocks work and what features I can add to make mine better also saw some previous photos of chess clocks and took some casing out of it, design out of it which i liked and developed my own. Also started designing the outer case in CAD, trying to make it more round and comfy to hold when pressing the buttons. Still figuring out where to put the LEDs and buzzer so it looks clean but also easy to see. Took me a bit of time to get the sizes right but it’s starting to look good now. I did some skectes of my ideas here are some photos and did a mind map with all the functions and process.![Screenshot 2025-10-19 215923.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM4MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--90c7f634955b01fe74e73435396f7eee15aa7a0a/Screenshot%202025-10-19%20215923.png)
  

## 10/19/2025 10:06 PM - intial and final drawing and final design  

I worked on the final design for my chess clock and made some drawings to see how everything will fit together. I changed a few things from my older idea to make it look cleaner and easier to hold. I tried different shapes for the case and button placement till it felt right. Also added some details for where the LEDs and LCD will go. I’m pretty happy with how it’s looking now, just need to check if all the parts will fit properly when I start building it. Here are the intial drawings i made had alot of ideas but heres 4 drawings i made the first one is gonna be my final drawing which i will draw in more depth. ![Screenshot 2025-10-19 220601.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM4MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--af4a91548bb2fb6979481c0f062de388667d0dc2/Screenshot%202025-10-19%20220601.png)
  

## 10/19/2025 10:07 PM - final drawing in depth  

I finished the final drawing for my chess clock design. This time I focused more on the small details like where each button, LED, and the LCD screen will go. I made sure the layout looks clean and comfortable to use when playing. I also adjusted the measurements so both sides are balanced and the hand position feels natural. Took a bit longer cause I was checking how the parts will fit inside and if there’s enough space for the wiring and buzzer. Overall I think the final drawing looks good and ready for CAD work next. I am documenting everything on slides and annottaitng them, as you can see in my photo. ![Screenshot 2025-10-19 220718.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM4NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1c9c32e43bc5bbf99253d5add43a423848fd8b10/Screenshot%202025-10-19%20220718.png)
  

## 10/19/2025 10:12 PM - Cardboard modelling using my previous electronics   

I started making a cardboard model of my chess clock using some of the old electronics I already had. I didn’t have all the parts but I used what I could to test how it might look and fit together. The cardboard helped me see the size and placement for the buttons, LEDs, and screen before I start making the real one. I also made an engineering slide where I documented everything I did and annotated all the parts to show how it’s coming together. i spent 2 hours on the design and prototyping the other hour on testing, annotating my engineering slides for this project so i can keep in track.![Screenshot 2025-10-19 221217.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM4OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ae004a483fa74a50876272606cc0d0c2ef4075ee/Screenshot%202025-10-19%20221217.png)
  

## 10/19/2025 10:16 PM - TinkerCAD testing and coding  

I worked on testing my chess clock circuit in TinkerCAD and also started coding some parts of it. I added the components like buttons, LEDs, buzzer, and the display to make sure everything connects right. Then I started writing and testing the basic timer code to see if both players’ sides switch correctly when pressing the buttons. It took some time fixing small errors and making sure the logic works like a real chess clock. Overall it went good and I got a better idea of how it’ll run when I build it for real. I also added notes in my code so it’s easier to understand later. The coding was the most hardest part of this which took a long time.![Tinker_Cad_Model.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM4OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7b005ad24034d012e829bdc729b1c6444e479d6b/Tinker_Cad_Model.png)
  

## 10/19/2025 10:24 PM - Final CAD model  

Finally finished the CAD model for my chess clock! Spent some time making sure all the parts fit well and the buttons, LEDs, and display are in the right spots, i made an exploded drawing use onshape which turned out really good to vizualize my CAD moddel how everything will be attached. I’m happy with how it looks and now the next step is to actually make it.![Screenshot 2025-10-19 222321.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM5MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--47c8c122c6ba40d91642fc2e6cee352e2b79b2d2/Screenshot%202025-10-19%20222321.png)
  

## 10/19/2025 10:29 PM - Final CAD model  

I found a problem in my previous design which had a smaller hole for the ardiuno ports, so I developed the holes and fixed my CAD model again. Spent about 30 mins making sure all the parts fit properly, like buttons, LEDs, and the display. Everything looks ready to actually make it.![Screenshot 2025-10-19 222543.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM5MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--cba75452be297f815fd6e17d8fdffac9bccfa497/Screenshot%202025-10-19%20222543.png)
